## Primary project objective
- This project serves as an introduction to Geographically Weighted Regression and illustrates a straightforward application of the method.

- Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is an exploratory data analysis technique for investigating nonstationary relationships in spatial data using regression analysis. GWR adds a level of modeling sophistication to ordinary least squares regression (OLS) by moving a weighted window over the data, estimating a set of coefﬁcient values at every chosen ‘ﬁt’ point. The ﬁt points can be at observed locations, but do not have to be. If the local coefﬁcients vary in space, it can be taken as an indication of non-stationarity.
